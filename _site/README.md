# Datatool Easy Fit Alarm System
## Installation & User Guide
Thank you for choosing the DATATOOL EVO, a motorcycle, scooter and quad alarm with movement sensing and voltage sensing capabilities.
This security system is designed as a deterrent and is not in itself a guarantee against theft prevention. We advise you that the more difficult you make your machine to be stolen the lower the potential risk.
Applying common sense and securing your machine with additional security every time you park plays a large part in this.  

## Installation Guide

> The DATATOOL EVO is designed for a simple installation and is pre wired ready to connect direct to the vehicle battery with the red terminal going to the positive connection and the black terminal to the negative, alternatively it may be hard wired as follows:

> **Wiring Connections**

> * **Red**                 :  +12V Permanent Supply, connect via 3A inline Fuse.

> * **Black**               :  Negative (Ground) Supply, connect to chassis earth or -ve battery pole.

> * **Blue**                :  Universal Trigger (optional), connect to switch or loop to ground

> * **2 Way** **Connector** : LED, Plug into LED

> Note: Upon connection of power to the alarm, the alarm will be armed and will trigger. Disarm by pressing the large button on the remote control.
The inline fuse fitted to the red wire should be concealed but be readily reached to disable the alarm in the event of losing a remote or for emergency override.
Secure the control unit to the vehicle using the provided cable ties and ensure the provided rubber pads are utilized to protect the control unit from vibration. Ensure control unit location does not interfere with any moving components or the normal operation of the vehicle. 



## Arm/Disarm Tones

!> IMPORTANT: The arm/disarm tones are switched off by default as this is a legislative requirement in certain countries. This means as standard, the LED is the only sign the alarm is operational, please check it carefully. If you prefer the alarm to make a noise on arm/disarm, please refer to the details in the Programming section of this user guide. This may not comply with legislation in your country. 

## The Remote Control

All EVO systems come with 2 remote controls as standard. It is possible to add up to 4 extra remote controls (6 in total).

The large button controls the main arm/disarm functions of the system.
The smaller button is used to initiate secondary functions such as movement sensor deletion (transport mode). Detailed operating instructions follow further in this guide.

When either button is pressed on the remote control, the LED will flash briefly to confirm the button has been pressed. If the button is held depressed the LED will flash approximately once a second for a maximum of 25 flashes. (The Remote will stop transmitting when flashes stop).

## Changing the Remote Battery
Each remote control contains a single long life lithium battery (CR2016). To replace the battery, locate the recess in the casing edge and gently prise the upper and lower casing of the remote apart at this point. The battery is retained by a spring and can be replaced by simply sliding the battery out from under the spring, noting the polarity and replacing with new. Ensure the battery polarity is correct when installing the new battery. Align the two casing halves and squeeze firmly to click the casing back together, ensuring the joint is even around the circumference.

## Operating the Alarm
 
### To arm the alarm: 
Press the large button on the remote control and the alarm will arm, a double chirp will be heard if arm/disarm tones are activated and the LED will illuminate for 3 seconds and then flash every second. This is called the ‘neutral time’ and is used to initialize the tilt and trigger inputs. After 10 seconds the alarm is fully armed and the LED flash rate is determined by the condition of the vehicle battery as follows:
* Fully charged, greater than 11.5V, LED flashes once every 5 seconds
* Partially discharged, between 11.5V and 10.5V, LED flashes every 10 seconds
* Low Battery, less than 10.5V, LED flashes every 20 seconds

**Notes:**
1. Voltages are approximate.
2. Alarm cannot be disarmed within 3 seconds of arming.
3. If armed in Transport/ Service mode the LED will flash in groups of 2 flashes, indicating the movement sensor is disabled
4. If armed in Battery Charge mode the LED will flash in groups of 3 flashes, indicating ignition detect is disabled.

### To arm/disarm silently (when tones are enabled): 
Press the small button on the remote and then within 3 seconds press the large button. The alarm will arm/disarm as normal except the chirp will be off for that one operation.

### To arm in Transport mode: 
This mode allows the movement sensor to be disabled whilst keeping a level of security on the motorcycle during transportation. When disarmed, press the large button to arm the alarm. The siren will start to chirp twice (if arm/disarm tones are activated) to indicate the alarm has been armed. Then within 3 seconds press the small button on the remote, the siren will chirp an extra time, three times in total (if arm/disarm tones are activated) to indicate the movement sensor has been disabled.

Note: If the ignition detect has been disabled by pressing both buttons after arming (see section 3.4 Arming in battery charge mode), then the transport mode cannot be activated.

### To arm in Battery Charge mode: 
Some battery chargers may cause a false trigger of the alarm system via the ignition sensor. If this is the case then the alarm can be armed with the ignition/ hotwire detect disabled. When disarmed, press the large button to arm the alarm. The siren will start to chirp twice (if arm/disarm tones are activated) to indicate the alarm has been armed.
Then within 3 seconds press both buttons simultaneously, the siren will chirp an extra two times, four times in total (if arm/disarm tones are activated) to indicate the ignition detect has been disabled.

Note: If the tilt sensor has been disabled via programming or by pressing the small button after arming (see above ‘To arm in Transport mode’) then the battery charger mode cannot be activated.

### To disarm the alarm: 
Press the large button on the remote control. The LED will extinguish and, if arm/disarm tones are activated, a single chirp will be heard. The alarm cannot be rearmed within 3 seconds of disarming.

### If the alarm system has triggered
Upon disarming the alarm the siren will sound one long beep and then the LED will flash and the siren will chirp indicating the trigger circuit. If the engine is cycled on then off the sequence will repeat. Arming the alarm system or running the engine for more than one minute will erase the trigger memory.

**Number of flashes/chirps:**

*((1)) Ignition circuit

*((2)) Seat switch

*((3)) Movement alert

*((4)) Panic function activated

*((5)) Power (vehicle battery) removal

### Auto re-arm: 
Selectable, switched off as standard. If enabled this function is disabled when engine on is detected.

Note: If the supply voltage remains high following an engine off event the auto-rearm may be unexpectedly disabled by the detection of pulses generated by auxiliary equipment.

### Triggering the Alarm

The alarm can be triggered by the following actions: tilt trigger, engine start, change of state trigger input (seat switch if fitted); panic button; power removed and re-applied.

When triggered, the siren will sound for 29 seconds. The alarm will then re-arm. If the fault is still present then the alarm will trigger again. Ignition, tilt, and change of state can only trigger a maximum of 10 times before the circuit in question is disabled. Panic will sound continuously, on for 29 seconds then off for 5 seconds and repeat. Power removed will sound for one 29 second cycle every time the power is reapplied.

## Optional Feature
### Panic mode:

Holding down the large button for 3 seconds will sound the siren. Press the large button once to stop the siren. Feature will operate in armed state with ignition on or off, and disarmed state with ignition off.



# Programming Mode

To enter programming mode disarm the alarm (wait 3 seconds), then hold down both buttons on the remote control for 3 seconds; the alarm will now start to chirp (one chirp, then 2 chirps, then 3 chirps, then 4 chirps, and finally 5 chirps). Select the item to be programmed by releasing the buttons after the appropriate chirp count.

Programmable items:
* 1 chirp Movement setting 
* 2 chirps Arm/disarm tones
* 3 chirps Auto re-arm
* 4 chirps Reset to defaults
* 5 chirps Adding/ removing remote controls

Once an item has been selected:

* LED flashes to indicate current setting
* The buzzer beeps to indicate current settings
* To change setting press large remote button to change up or small button to change down, setting will roll round in either direction
* To exit and save press both buttons, or wait 30 seconds without pressing either button. The Alarm will sound a long beep when exiting programming mode.

## Movement Sensitivity (Tilt Adjustment)
The LED will flash and buzzer beep in sets of 1 up to 4 indicating the current setting:
1. Off
2. Low sensitivity
3. Medium sensitivity (default)
4. High sensitivity

## Arm/Disarm Tones
The LED will flash and buzzer beep in sets of 1 up to 3 indicating the current setting:
1. Arm/disarm tones off (default)
2. Arm/disarm tones quiet
3. Arm/disarm tones on

## Auto Re-Arm
The LED will flash and buzzer beep in sets of two if the auto re-arm function is on and single flashes if the auto re-arm function is off. Default is off.

## Reset to Default
To reset to defaults set the LED to flash twice and buzzer beep twice. To exit without resetting to defaults set the LED to flash once and buzzer beep once.

## Adding/Removing Remote Controls
The LED flash count and buzzer beep count will show the number of remotes programed to work with the alarm.
Pressing the large button on the remote, existing or new, will add this to the system and delete all previously entered remote controls. Press the large button on each remote control that is required; the buzzer will beep as each valid remote is pressed and then the LED flash/buzzer beep count will increase as each remote is added. If the maximum number of remotes has been reached then the LED flash/ buzzer beep count will not increase indicating that the last remote pressed has not been saved.

!> Important: If all working remote controls are lost or damaged it is not possible to reprogram the alarm. Always ensure you have at least one spare remote control programmed to operate the alarm.
